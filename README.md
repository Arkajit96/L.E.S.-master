//Introduction 
 This is an individual project by Arkajit Banerjee who has been responsible for all the front-end and back-end part of the project. In this project I tried implementing a prototype of a lecture evaluation system with student and professor side. The professor side is capable of seeing which students have answered the survey so that they can provide incentives to them. The answers of the surve are being stored in the database which can be further extracted for the purpose of analyzing teaching styles which was required to be connected to ChartJS. The individual answers cannot be seen by the professors due to privacy issues of the students. 

//Objective 
Through this project I wanted to build a lecture evaluation system with a nice user interface. I wanted to make the design fully responsive. I wanted to master technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL and PHP. I wanted to solve the problem of low response rates by students at the University of Pittsburgh. It provides information in a convenient and intuitive way.Function on desktop and mobile devices to allow for more versatility.

Front End-HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT, Bootstrap, ChartJS
Back-End-MySQL,PHP
MVC stands for Model, View & Controller.
The controller mediates between the models and views.
Let’s now briefly discuss each component of the MVC design pattern.
Model – this part is concerned with the business logic and the application data. It can be used to perform data validations, process data and store it. The data can come from;
database
XML document
Other valid data sources.
Controller – This is the part deals with the users’ requests for resources from the server.
As an example, when the users requests for emails the controller will load the emails to retrieve the data then output the results in the list view.
In a nutshell, the controller links the models and views together depending on the requested resources.
Views – this part deals with presenting the data to the user. This is usually in form of HTML pages.


//Challenges 
I tried implementing Charts using ChartJS but I found lack of documentation. Also, I felt that it was a difficult project for an individual person for so many features. ChartJS was something I could use ChartJS for front end but could not connect to backend. Also, I tried doing the whole website using my computer using nodejs but I found it difficult to set up an environment. Later, I decided to go for simple PHP with MySQL.
Future Work
I would definitely love to connect the backend with chartjs. Also, I would like to do it with nodejs.


//Conclusion 
The course web technologies and standards was definitely a course where I learnt a lot. I would say that nodejs, APIs, MongoDb have been the most useful technologies I learnt.
